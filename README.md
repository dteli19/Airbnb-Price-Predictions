# üè† Airbnb Price Prediction ‚Äî Asheville, NC

### **Overview**
This project builds a complete **machine learning pipeline** to predict Airbnb listing prices in **Asheville, North Carolina**, using real-world data from the **Inside Airbnb** dataset.  
It walks through all stages of the data science process ‚Äî from cleaning and exploration to neural network modeling ‚Äî to uncover how factors like location, property type, and host attributes influence nightly pricing.

### **Problem Statement**
Airbnb hosts and analysts often struggle to determine fair and competitive listing prices.  
The objective of this project is to **predict nightly prices** based on listing attributes such as **room type, host behavior, and reviews**, while also identifying the most influential pricing drivers.

### **About the Data**
- **Source**: [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) (city export ‚Äî `listings.csv`)  
- **Focus City**: Asheville, North Carolina  
- **Key Features**:  

| **Numerical** | **Categorical** |
|----------------|----------------|
| `price` | `room_type` |
| `bathrooms` | `host_identity_verified` |
| `bedrooms` | `host_is_superhost` |
| `number_of_reviews` |  |
| `latitude` |  |
| `longitude` |  |

### **Steps Performed**

![Workflow](Workflow.png)  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading**
- Imported `listings.csv` and verified schema and data consistency.  
- Checked dataset shape and previewed top rows for validation.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Selection (Asheville, NC)**
- Filtered listings for **Asheville, NC** using city/state fields and geographic bounds.  
- Retained compact numeric and categorical columns for model interpretability.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Dropped rows with missing `price` values (target variable).  
- Cleaned numerical columns and converted non-numeric strings.  
- Filled missing `host_is_superhost` using **mode imputation** (most frequent value).  
- Converted `'t'/'f'` ‚Üí `True/False` and ensured correct data types.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary of key numeric variables.  
- **Histograms & Pairplots**: Distribution of price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and reviews.  
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identified strong predictors of price.  
- **Outlier Handling**: Applied 99th percentile rule to cap extreme prices.  
- **Geospatial Map**: Interactive visualization showing pricing clusters across Asheville.  

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling (Keras Regression Network)**
- Normalized features and performed **train-test split (80/20)**.  
- Built a Keras Sequential model with:
  - Normalization Layer  
  - 1 Hidden Layer (64 neurons, ReLU activation)  
  - Output Layer for regression (price prediction)
- Trained over 50 epochs with validation split.  
- Evaluated using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R¬≤**.

### **Results**

![Training vs Validation](TV.png) 

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | ~64.5 |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | ~98.6 |
| R¬≤ (Explained Variance) | ~0.41 |

- The model achieved stable convergence, showing consistent training and validation loss curves.  
- Predicted prices align closely with actual values, capturing location and review-driven variations effectively.

### **Business Impact**

![Actual vs Predict](AP.png)

‚úÖ Enables **dynamic pricing strategies** for Airbnb hosts.  
‚úÖ Helps identify **undervalued or overvalued properties** based on their features.  
‚úÖ Offers **data-backed insights** for improving property visibility and revenue optimization.  

### **Takeaways**
- **Data quality and missingness handling** critically affect model reliability.  
- **Mode imputation and normalization** provide stability for mixed-type datasets.  
- **Location and reviews** emerged as key price determinants.  
- The workflow can be easily **replicated for any Airbnb city** with minimal code changes.
